# Angular Evaluation

Why using [Angular][1] for a project? To determine your choice you should evaluate some aspects of this popular javascript framework. You should have a look at [React][5] and [Vue.js][6], too, the two other players in this section. But the goal of this article is to show you how you can evaluate the use of Angular for your project. The other two frameworks are not gonna be lit up here and there will not be a comparsion between them. You should be given the right arguments for Angular to make sense to take the framework and the way it is used, without getting into technical deep details.

We want to look who is behind Angular, the creater as well the community. Then we want to see how it should be used and which projects it already use. Last but not least we want to compare it, but not between React or Vue, more like between libraries and frameworks in generell. Well with this in mind let's start.

## Introduction

In 2010[^1] [Google][0] released [AngularJS][2], the first version of Angular under [MIT License][7] and build with [JavaScript][10]. Almost six years later[^2] in 2016 the second version was released just called [Angular][1] (without JS) and written in [TypeScript][11], the programming language designed by [Microsoft][13] in 2012[^3].

# Angular Evaluation

Why using [Angular][1] for a project? To determine your choice you should evaluate some aspects of this popular javascript framework. You should have a look at [React][5] and [Vue.js][6], too, the two other main players in this section. But the goal of this article is to show you how you can evaluate the use of Angular for your project. You should be given the right arguments for Angular to make sense to take this framework and the way it is used, without getting into technical deep details.

To save you some time, let me some up something for you: Angular is still as good as React or as Vue.js, but the right choice depends on a wide range of factors which make it more or less suitable for the clients enviroment.

## Where to start?

The killer argument for Angular is its place in [Ionic][14]. Ionic is used for mobile development to build cross platform hyprid apps. One codebase, any platform. So if it comes to this framework (Ionic) Angular is the only choice.

Furthermore Angular is a mature framework and should be taken for big projects. If you have complex business logic, Angular is your choice. If you have complex routing or form validation, Angular is your choice. If you wanna write closed applications with one codebase, Angular is you choice.

## Developer

Two important questions for every tool you use are how mature is it and who is behind it. Angular come from a good family: [Google][0]. Igor Minar, one of the main developer, said that Angular is used in [more than 600 hundred applications in Google][15] such as Firebase Console, Google Analytics, Google Express, Google Cloud Platform and more. Since it is started in the year 2010 more than 400 developers and a big community put their efforts in it.

## Features

Angular has more features out of the box than React. This can be a good thing, this can be a bad thing. It depends how you look at it. 

> Some of these features are built-in into the core of the framework and you donâ€™t have an option not to use them. This requires developers to be familiar with features such as dependency injection to build even a small Angular application. Other features such as the HTTP client or forms are completely optional and can be added on an as-needed basis.

As I mentioned it before I do not want to get into technical depth, but if you're interested in it, here are some buzzwords Angular comes with: Dependency injection, templates, routing, ajax requests, form building, CSS encapsulation, XSS protection, some utilities for unit testing and [RxJS][19]. Well, very technically. But the following two interesting things are worth to know it: TypeScript and Angular Elements.

### TypeScript

[TypeScript][11] is a programming language developed by [Microsoft][17] and actively adopt by Angular. It is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean, simple [JavaScript][10]. TypeScript is influenced by Java and .NET, so developers are likely to find it easier to learn than plain JavaScript. Well we switched from the tool to the environment. More about this later at the section [Human Resources](#human-resources).

### Angular Elements

[Angular Elements][20] are used for defining new HTML elements in a framework way. Once an element is defined it will be rendered everywhere in the HTML. Its content is created and controlled by JavaScript. Angular provide an API to make it work with the own change detection machanism. The development team of Angular are working on [Angular Elements as a service][22].

## Human Resources

Another important question to ask before choosing Angular for the upcoming project is which developers are at your disposal. "It's standing and it's falling with people." used to say my grandma. And so if there are some high skilled Angular developers there to realize this project, just choose it. But keep in mind if there are only one or two developers on board, the project might depends on these guys. Good developers are rare these times.
